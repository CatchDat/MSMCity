# MSMCity - City-level Commute Microsimulation

## Overview

Combine user data harvested from mobile phone app with a simulated population at a city-wide (local authority) level, in order to synthesise an OD matrix of commute patterns. 

Only economically active people (according to census data) are considered. 

User data comprises of home and work locations, plus timestamped breadcrumb data, mode of travel

### Data Sources
1. Census data: MSOA-level populations with the following characteristics: 
- sex
- age band (6 levels)
- economic activity (full/part-time (self) employed)
- number of households per MSOA
- MSOA of workplace

(number of workplaces per MSOA would be useful)

2. TravelAI app data:
- home lat/lon
- work lat/long
- timestamped breadcrumb data
- mode of travel?

Approximately 5000 working population per MSOA
Approximately 5000 houeholds per MSOA


## Methodology

### Microsimulation

Automated download (and cacheing of) census data from www.nomisweb.co.uk.

Generate synthetic population categorised on sex, age band, economic activity type, from census data
Assign home location randomly within MSOA (will not match distribution of household sizes)

Assign cleaned app user data to the synthetic population. (Map home loc to closest random microsim home point?)

Create OD matrix based on 
1. initially one home location per MSOA. 
2. spread population by assigning home location to randomly sampled points within MSOA (using no. of households in MSOA)
3. Single workplace


## Detail

### Census API

#### Metadata

1. Translate local authority string e.g "Newcastle upon Tyne" to MOSA codes (nomisweb internal, not "standard")

2. Query table to determine what fields (columns) available.

3. Construct appropriate queries and retrieve data. Data is cached locally to reduce load on remote server. 
(The service requires an API key for unlimited downloads - without this results can be truncated)


### Routing API

3. Construct appropriate queries and retrieve data. Data is cached locally to reduce load on remote server. 
(The service requires an API key and queries are limited to a daily maximum)
