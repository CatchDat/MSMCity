This paper presents a methodology to "scale-up" crowdsourced commuter movement data from a small sample to the entire working population, building on techniques developed in the field of spatial microsimulation: MSMCity, short for meso-scale spatial microsimulation at the city level. The method was motivated by the need for synthetic movement data as a basis for Agent-Based Modelling (ABM), e.g. to model travel patterns and simulate scenarios of change. MSMCity builds on a spatial microdataset of residential populations in which agents are categorised by demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic variables, including: age, gender, in addition to home and work locations derived from origin-destination data. Additional variables can be added for applied work: mode of travel and economic activity were included at the individual level to illustrate the method's potential for modelling targetted policy interventions. Case studies from Newcastle and Ilkley, UK, demonstrate the method's scalability nationally. To enable reproducibility and ease extensions, the code underlying the MSMCity method has been packaged into an R package of the same name, to automate the process as far as is possible. We conclude that the method and represents a step towards the long sought-after integration of the fields of spatial microsimulation and agent-based modelling. Future work could build on the method to simulate settlement travel patterns anywhere in the world using global datasets such as OpenStreetMap.

# Introduction

This paper presents a method to simulate travel patterns at a large scale. The method is based on synthetic spatial microdata, of the type produced in spatial microsimulation models [@lovelace_spatial_2016], extending established techniques to incorporate origin-destination data to estimate travel patterns down to the road network level. The methodological developments are driven by the utility of model experiments to help prioritise transport interventions in applied research and practice [@mouter_empirical_2017].

In order to create a large-scale (e.g. citywide) Agent-Based Model, one requires individual-level data on the entire population. Typically this data is simply not available, not least for confidentiality reasons. Hence there is a need to synthesise realistic datasets of this size and level of detail, using a process called microsynthesis.

For this application, we have a set of detailed individual-level data that has been crowdsourced via mobile phone apps. This data provides depth but not breadth, covering a tiny fraction of the population.

Also available to us is UK census data (2011) which provides aggregate data for the entire population, providing breadth but lacking the depth of the crowdsourced data.

By combining the two sources of data, we can construct a realistic (but artificial) population and identify persons in it that correspond to app users. Using an Agent-Based Model, individual behaviours on a large scale can be modelled with the real app user data being used as feedback in order to calibrate the model.

## Methodology

### Data Sources

1. Census data from nomisweb.co.uk, using RESTful API. 
2. TravelAI app data.
3. Routing data from transportAPI.com and graphhopper.com, using RESTful API.

### Data Resolution

Whilst the app data provides depth, giving very detailed information about app users and their movements, it does not provide breadth as there simply aren't enough app users so simulate movements of large numbers of people. We use census data at the mid-layer super output area (MSOA). These represent a geographic area with a mean population of about 7000, and from this data we can get a breakdown of the population in terms of demographic and socioeconomic categories. No further geographical resolution is available, other than the count of workplaces locations (again at MSOA resolution).

In order to pinpoint home and workplace locations, random (within MSOA) sampling was used. 

The app data consisted of pseudonymised individual-level data from TravelAI. Only about 600 users were present in the supplied dataset.

### Demographic, Geographic and Socioeconomic Categories

1. Aggregate census data
- gender (M/F)
- age band (6 categories: 16-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65+)
- economic activity (4 categories: full/part-time (self) employed)
- MSOA of workplace
- Commute mode of transport

2. TravelAI individual data:
- anonymised ID
- home location lat/long
- work location lat/long
- timestamped breadcrumb data
- mode of travel?
- gender
- age mapped to age band

## Population Synthesis

Most, if not all, established techniques (e.g. Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF)) for population synthesis cannot generate whole-number populations for each category. This is not ideal for ABM applications, which really require whole individuals. Whilst it is possible to "integerise" a non-integral population, this process may not exactly preserve the original marginal constraints.

This motivated us to develop a novel and extremely fast synthesis technique, using a combination of quasirandom numbers and without-replacement marginal sampling. This technique only produces populations in the integer domain, so is well-suited as a foundation for ABM. The technique is described in (Smith, Lovelace, Birkin unpublished).

Firstly, given a user-specified region, the census API is queried for a list of MSOAs within the region. Then, the software automatically downloads (or retrieves from its cached data), aggregate census data:

- gender
- age band (10 year buckets)
- economic activity
- work location (MSOA)
- commute mode of transport

From this data we generate a synthetic population, and assign home and work locations randomly within the respective MSOAs.

Next we assign app users to the synthetic population, matching the above categories and use their actual recorded home and work locations (rather than the randomly assigned ones).

## Software Detail

Each API requres a key without which downloads will be restricted or even unavailable. Obtaining a key will require registering with the sites.

The usual practice for API keys in `R` should be adhered to, i.e. they should be added to the user's `.Renviron` file, like so:

```
NOMIS_API_KEY = 0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
GRAPHHOPPER = 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef
TRANSPORT_API = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
```

### Census API

The following functionality is available:

1. Translate local authority string e.g "Newcastle upon Tyne" to MSOA code(s) (nomisweb internal, not "standard"), for use in later queries

2. Query tables to determine what fields (columns) available.

3. Query building - construct appropriate queries and retrieve data. Since census data is essentially static it is cached locally to reduce load on remote server. The cacheing is keyed on a hash of the request URL. 

4. Query execution and download.

### Routing APIs

The following functionality is available:

1. Retrieve route information from graphhopper. Only supports road travel, and has no public transport information.

2. Retrieve route information from transportapi. Supports car, public transport and cycle modes.

### Visualisation

1. Plot origins and/or destinations as points

2. Plot routes.

3. (Work-in-progress) heat map 

## Algorithm

1. Select region or regions

2. Construct queries to collect the following data:
- MSOAs within region
- per MSOA (working) population data: age band, gender, economic activity type, workplace MSOA, normal mode of transport

3. Synthesise population 

4. Extract users from app data, including age band, gender, (economic activity assumed), lon/lat of home and work

5. Assign users to synthetic population

4. For remainder of population, sample and assign OD points (randomly) within each MSOA

5. Use routing API to generate routes

6. Plot routes

# Software Usage

The software is an `R` package, `MSMCity`. Scripts and functions are logically split:

`AppUsers.R`: functions to select app users geographically, and manipulate the data for consistency with census data.

`Geography.R`: functions to assign home and work locations to individuals, route assignment, some visualisation functions, plus a listing of all local authorities in England & Wales.

`MSIM.R`: the main script entry point.

`SynPop.R`: the main microsimulation and population synthesis function.

`Travel.R`: functions to map modes of transport, compatibility between census and transportAPI values.

`api/NomiswebApi.R`: automated downloads of census metadata and data, including: MSOAs by local authority, socioeconomic data, workplace locations, number of households, modes of transport. Downloaded data is cached locally to reduce server load.

`api/TransportApi.R`: automated route generation.

Normal usage would involve editing the array of local authorities defined in `MSIM.R`, e.g.:

```
> regions=c("Newcastle upon Tyne", "North Tyneside", "Gateshead", "South Tyneside",
          "Sunderland")

```
for a metropolitan county, or 
```
> regions=c("Newcastle upon Tyne")

```
for a single local authority, or
```
> regions=c("Bradford 001")

```

for a single MSOA.

# Example Output

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.show="hold", fig.cap="Randomly simulated origins and destinations for a single MSOA. Working population: 5929"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/IlkleyO.png","figures/IlkleyD.png")) 
```

Why can't knitr anchor figures???

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.show="hold", fig.cap="A sample of commute routes for a single MSOA. Private road transport."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figures/IlkleyCarRoutes.png")) 
```


# Further Work

The purpose of this is to provide a foundation for an Agent-Based Model or Models. Since this has not been done yet, some further (unforeseen) modifications may potentially be necessary.


## Known Issues

Census data does not provide any interdependence between work location and mode of travel. NomisWeb does not have a census table containing both work location (MSOA) and mode of travel to work. This can result in assigning unrealistic  home/works locations to non-app users.

The APIs, and particularly transportApi, have limits on the number of queries made in a given period (e.g. 1000 per day). This restricts the amount of routing data that can be queried at a given time. By spreading route queries over different APIs, this problem can be reduced. However graphhopper is more limited in that it only supports road journeys in private transport.

Individuals have randomly (within MSOA) assigned home and work locations. In rural areas in particular, this can result in unlikely locations with no roads nearby, and may cause routing API calls to fail. A potential improvement is to obtain dwelling (and potentially workplace) location data per MSOA (from e.g. OpenStreetMap) and randomly assign these locations to individuals.
